- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GlowHurtHuman
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Infosec, Home Labs, Linux, Personal Security, and anything else that grabs my attention.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to repair my old laptop so I can either turn it into a cheap personal Proxmox server or install a Linux District on it to learn more.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: glowhurthuman@proton.me
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently working on some courses to see if I'd like to switch careers from a non-tech job to Infosec/Cybersecurity
